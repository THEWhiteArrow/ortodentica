# OrtoDentica Web Page Project

Welcome to my first real-life web development project, created for OrtoDentica—the dental clinic that took care of my smile! This project was a special opportunity for me to give back to a befriended company and my own stomatologist. It marks the beginning of my professional journey in web development.

**Project started:** 2021  
**Author:** Damian Trafiałek
